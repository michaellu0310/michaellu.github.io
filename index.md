# Project 1: EDR Attack and Defense Home Lab

[EDR-Attack-and-Defense](https://github.com/michaellu0310/EDR-Attack-and-Defense).

In this project, I set up a home lab environment to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios. Using a Linux Ubuntu virtual machine as the attacker and a Windows 11 virtual machine as the victim, I implemented and tested key SOC (Security Operations Center) concepts. This included deploying Sliver for command-and-control operations, configuring LimaCharlie as an EDR solution, and importing Sysmon logs for monitoring. The project enhanced my understanding of endpoint security, incident detection, and response strategies within a controlled lab setting.
